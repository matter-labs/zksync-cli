## üõ† Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.x
- NPM / Yarn

## üì• Installation

You can install this program globally with `npm i -g zksync-cli` or run the commands directly via NPX with `npx zksync-cli@latest {COMMAND}`.

## üíª Commands

- `zksync-cli help`: Provides detailed information about each command. 

- `zksync-cli create {PROJECT_NAME}`: creates a new project in the given project name. If not provided, creates the project in the current folder, although this requires the folder to be empty.

- `zksync-cli deposit`: deposits funds from L1 to L2 (local, testnet or mainnet). It will ask to enter: network, recipient wallet, amount in ETH (eg 0.1) and the private key of the wallet you're sending the funds from.

- `zksync-cli withdraw`: withdraws funds from zkSync 2.0 to L1 (Goerli testnet). It will ask to enter: network, recipient wallet, amount in ETH (eg 0.1) and the private key of the wallet you're sending the funds from.

- `zksync-cli confirm-withdraw`: confirms withdrawal of funds from zkSync 2.0 to L1 (Goerli testnet). It will ask to enter: network, withdrawal transaction address and the private key of the wallet you sent the funds from.

- `zksync-cli <command> --help`: Provides detailed information about how to use a specific command. Replace <command> with the name of the command you want help with (e.g., create, deposit, withdraw, confirm-withdraw).

- `zksync-cli --version`: Returns the current version.

- `--l2-rpc-url`: override the default L2 rpc URL when `localnet` is selected as the network. Usage `--l1-rpc-url=http://...`.
